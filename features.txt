SLEEP DATA FEATURE ENGINEERING
==============================

This module extracts physiological features from sleep data collected using the E4 wearable device.
Features are calculated on downsampled windows (1Hz and 0.03Hz/30-second epochs).

FEATURES DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

BVP Features (Blood Volume Pulse, 64Hz):
- BVP_mean: Average blood volume pulse, reflects overall blood flow
- BVP_std: Standard deviation, indicates pulse variability
- BVP_min: Minimum value, represents lowest blood volume point
- BVP_max: Maximum value, represents highest blood volume point
- BVP_median: Median value, robust measure less affected by outliers
- BVP_range: Range (max-min), indicates pulse amplitude

IBI Features (Inter-Beat Interval, in ms):
- IBI_mean: Average time between heartbeats, inverse of heart rate
- RMSSD: Root Mean Square of Successive Differences, reflects parasympathetic activity
- PNN50: Percentage of intervals >50ms different from preceding interval
- SDNN: Standard Deviation of NN intervals, overall heart rate variability

ACC Features (Accelerometer, 32Hz):
- ACC_magnitude_mean: Average movement intensity (√(x²+y²+z²))
- ACC_magnitude_std: Variability in movement intensity
- ACC_movement_density: Proportion of time with movement above threshold
- ACC_burst_count: Number of distinct movement episodes

EDA Features (Electrodermal Activity, 4Hz):
- EDA_mean: Average skin conductance, indicates sympathetic nervous activity
- EDA_std: Variability in skin conductance
- EDA_trend: Slope of EDA change, direction of sympathetic activity change

TEMP Features (Temperature, 4Hz):
- TEMP_mean: Average skin temperature
- TEMP_std: Variability in skin temperature
- TEMP_slope: Rate of temperature change over time window

HR Features (Heart Rate, 1Hz):
- HR_mean: Average heart rate in beats per minute
- HR_std: Variability in heart rate
- HR_range: Max HR - Min HR, range of heart rate during the window
- HR_trend: Slope of heart rate change, indicates acceleration/deceleration
