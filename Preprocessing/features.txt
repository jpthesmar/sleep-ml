PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNAL FEATURES DOCUMENTATION

This document provides descriptions for features extracted from various physiological signals: BVP (Blood Volume Pulse), IBI (Inter-Beat Interval), ACC (Accelerometer), EDA (Electrodermal Activity), TEMP (Temperature), and HR (Heart Rate).

========================================
BVP FEATURES (BLOOD VOLUME PULSE)
========================================

BVP_mean: Mean value of the BVP signal within the window, representing average blood volume changes

BVP_std: Standard deviation of the BVP signal, indicating variability in blood volume

BVP_min: Minimum value of the BVP signal in the window

BVP_max: Maximum value of the BVP signal in the window

BVP_range: Range of BVP values (max-min), indicating the amplitude of blood volume changes

BVP_median: Median value of the BVP signal, less sensitive to outliers than the mean

========================================
IBI FEATURES (INTER-BEAT INTERVAL)
========================================

SDNN: Standard Deviation of NN (Normal-to-Normal) intervals, a common time-domain HRV measure indicating overall heart rate variability

median_nni: Median of NN intervals in milliseconds, representing the central tendency of heartbeat timing

IBI_mean: Mean of Inter-Beat Intervals in milliseconds, representing average time between consecutive heartbeats

========================================
ACC FEATURES (ACCELEROMETER)
========================================

x_std: Standard deviation of acceleration in the X-axis, indicating variability of movement in this direction

y_std: Standard deviation of acceleration in the Y-axis, indicating variability of movement in this direction

z_std: Standard deviation of acceleration in the Z-axis, indicating variability of movement in this direction

mag_mean: Mean of the acceleration magnitude (sqrt(x²+y²+z²)), representing overall movement intensity

mag_std: Standard deviation of the acceleration magnitude, indicating variability in overall movement intensity

mag_max: Maximum acceleration magnitude in the window, representing peak movement intensity

movement_density: Proportion of samples where acceleration magnitude exceeds threshold (mean + 1 std), indicating frequency of significant movements

burst_count: Number of transitions from below to above threshold, representing distinct movement initiations

========================================
EDA FEATURES (ELECTRODERMAL ACTIVITY)
========================================

EDA_mean: Mean EDA level, representing average skin conductance related to arousal and sweat gland activity

EDA_std: Standard deviation of EDA, indicating variability in skin conductance/arousal

EDA_trend: Slope of the linear regression line fitted to EDA values, indicating whether arousal is increasing (positive) or decreasing (negative)

========================================
TEMP FEATURES (SKIN TEMPERATURE)
========================================

TEMP_mean: Mean skin temperature during the window

TEMP_std: Standard deviation of skin temperature, indicating temperature stability

TEMP_slope: Slope of the linear regression line fitted to temperature values, indicating whether temperature is increasing (positive) or decreasing (negative)

========================================
HR FEATURES (HEART RATE)
========================================

HR_mean: Mean heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) during the window

HR_std: Standard deviation of heart rate, indicating heart rate variability

HR_range: Range of heart rate values (max-min), representing the extent of heart rate changes

HR_trend: Slope of the linear regression line fitted to heart rate values, indicating whether heart rate is increasing (positive) or decreasing (negative)
